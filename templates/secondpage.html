      <h2>About Deepfake Detection</h2>
      <p>Deepfakes are a type of synthetic media where a person's face or voice is replaced with another person's in a video or audio recording. This technology can be used for entertainment purposes, but it can also be misused to create fake news, spread misinformation, or damage someone's reputation.</p>
      <p>Deepfake detection tools are software applications designed to identify and authenticate the origin of media, particularly videos and audio recordings. These tools use various techniques, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to analyze patterns and inconsistencies in the media that might indicate manipulation.</p>
      <p>Our Deepfake Detection Tool is designed to be a user-friendly and accessible platform for anyone to analyze media for potential deepfakes. By uploading an image or video, our tool utilizes advanced algorithms to assess the authenticity of the media and provide insights into its origin.</p>
